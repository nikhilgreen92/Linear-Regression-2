# Linear-Regression-2
For data, we are using Ecommerce customers dataset wherein we are going to write algorithms based on Linear Regression. The data contains 500 rows and 8 columns. We'll try to find the best fit line so that loss functions are minimum and we achieve the best fit line for the data. Steps used--- a) Importing the dependencies like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn b) Importing the data to read what's contained in the dataset. c) Basic data exploration using head, info. d) EDA using pairplot, lmplot, corelation, heatmap and distplot e) Train Test split the datset. f) Feature scaling using standard scaler. g) Importing Linear regression model h) Predictions to be done on testing dataset. i) Regression evaluation metrics i.e MAE, MSE, RMSE j) Getting individual coefficients. k) Conclusion: From here we can dedude that the the time spent on app gives better return on yearly spent amount therefore we shall focus on building App or either we shall work hard so that website catches with the App such that returns can increase.
